Intro to Python in Data Science:

1)type(variable_name) ==> type fn gives the data type of the variable.
2)we cant concatinate diff datatypes in python,we have to type cast them to add
  Eg :print ("my BMI is : " + BMI) ==> this will throw compilation error,hence we need to type catt BMI(float type) to String
     i.e print ("my BMI is : " + str(BMI)) ==> o/p my BMI is : 20.798281126222715
     lly we can do below things as well
      1.print("I can add integers, like " + str(5) + " to strings.") ==> o/p =I can add integers, like 5 to strings.
    **2. print("I said " + ("Hey " * 2) + "Hey!")                    ==> o/p =I said Hey Hey Hey!
   ***3. print(True + False)                                         ==> o/p =1
3)variable declaration with values
    ==> int = 1 (integers)
    ==> float = 1.1 (real numbers)
    ==> str = "Bulzer" (string or text values)
    ==> bool = True (true or false)
4) One more data type is lists
    --> lists can store values of diff data types
    --> lists are enclosed in sq. braces
    --> lists can contain other lists in them
    -->Eg: list1 = ["Bulzer",24,"human"]
