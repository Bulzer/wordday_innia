1)UNIVERSITY COURSE CREDIT:
   edX's MicroMasters Credential program allows MOOC learners, like you, to get credit towards courses for a Masters degree on various university campuses (affiliated with edX).  
   Current Masters Options:
  Currently, learners who successfully earn the MicroMasters Credential are eligible to apply for admission to the Master of Predictive Analytics program at Curtin University.
  If a learner applies for admission to the Master of Predictive Analytics program at Curtin University, and is accepted, the MicroMasters Credential will count towards 25% (or 100 credits of the 400 credits) of the coursework required for graduation in the Curtin program.
  Future Masters Options:
  At UCSD, we are committed to giving learners everywhere access to the quality, state-of-the-art data science training and preparation we provide our own Masters students in San Diego.  We plan to work with other edX partner universities with appropriate Masters programs to encourage them to accept our MicroMasters courses for credit within their own programs.  We'll update this page as we do this. These courses are designed directly from our own courses on campus and we believe they serve as an excellent foundation for many Masters programs preparing data scientists.

2)For those of you interested in a career in data science, this is the first course in a four-course edX MicroMasters.
The next three courses are Statistics, Machine Learning, and Spark (data analysis for big data). 

3)To receive a MicroMasters Certificate in Data Science you must receive verified certificates in the following courses:
    Python for Data Science
   Statistics and Probability in Data Science using Python
   Machine Learning for Data Science
   Big Data Analytics using Spark
  Learners who receive their MicroMasters in Data Science Certificate are currently eligible to apply to the Master of Predictive Analytics program at Curtin University.A MicroMasters in Data Science can be converted into a maximum of 100 units in this program as directed by the Curtin program course listing below.
    MEDA5003 Multidisciplinary Data Visualization and Interpretation (25 credits)
    STAT5001 Statistical Probability (12.5 credits)
    STAT5006 Statistical Data Analysis 1 (12.5 credits)
    ISYS5007 Data Management (25 credits)
    Elective (25 credits)
